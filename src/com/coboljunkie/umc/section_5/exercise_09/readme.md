<h3>Area Calculator</h3>
Write a method named area with one double parameter named radius.

The method needs to return a double value that represents the area of a circle.<br>

If the parameter radius is negative then return -1.0 to represent an invalid value.<br>

Write another overloaded method with 2 parameters x and y (both doubles), where x and y represent the sides of a rectangle.

The method needs to return an area of a rectangle.

If either or both parameters is/are a negative return -1.0 to indicate an invalid value.

For formulas and PI value please check the tips below.
<br><br>
Examples of input/output:

<li>area(5.0); should return 78.53975</li>

<li>area(-1);  should return -1 since the parameter is negative</li>

<li>area(5.0, 4.0); should return 20.0 (5 * 4 = 20)</li>

<li>area(-1.0, 4.0);  should return -1 since first the parameter is negative</li>
<br><br>




TIP: The formula for calculating the area of a rectangle is x * y.

TIP: The formula for calculating a circle area is radius * radius * PI.

TIP: For PI use a constant from Math class e.g. Math.PI

NOTE: All methods need to be defined as public static â€‹like we have been doing so far in the course.

NOTE: Do not add a main method to your solution code!
